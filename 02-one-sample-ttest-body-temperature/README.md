## Background
Medical guidelines have historically cited 98.6°F as the average human body temperature.
Recent research has questioned whether this value accurately represents modern populations.

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to statistically evaluate whether the true mean body temperature
of a sample population differs from the historical reference value of 98.6°F.

## Approach
A one-sample t-test was performed to compare the sample mean body temperature to the hypothesized
population mean of 98.6°F. Prior to inference, distributional assumptions were assessed using
histograms and normal probability plots(Q-Q plot).

## Outcome
The analysis determines whether there is sufficient statistical evidence, at the 5% significance
level, to conclude that average body temperature differs from 98.6°F.

## Deliverables
1. SAS program implementing exploratory analysis, assumption checks, and a one-sample t-test
2. Publication-ready PDF report containing tables, figures, and statistical conclusions
3. Project documentation describing the analytical objective, methodology, and findings
